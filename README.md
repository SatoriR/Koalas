# Koalas

I've always thought that Koalas are fascinating animals. Their population has declined nearly 45% since 1960, falling from 600,000 to nearly 330,000 according to numerous. 
This is extremely bad news as Koalas have a very slow rate of reproduction of merely 1, that's right, 1 baby koala also known as a joey every 2 years.
